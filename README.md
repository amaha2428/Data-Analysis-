# Financial Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview:

Developed an interactive financial analysis dashboard using Power BI to visualize and analyze company financial data for the years 2013 and 2014.

## Key Highlights:

**Profit by Month:**
- Created a bar chart visualizing monthly profits, identifying October as the most profitable month with a profit of 3.4M.
- There are significant fluctuations in monthly profits, with a noticeable drop after October.

**Profit by Country:**
- Analyzed profit distribution by country, showcasing France as the leading country with a profit of 3.8M, followed closely by Germany with 3.7M.
- The United States, despite having the highest sales, has a lower profit compared to France and Germany.

**Sales by Country:**
- Designed a pie chart to represent sales distribution across countries, with the United States achieving the highest sales at 25.03M, contributing 21.08% to the total sales.
- Sales are relatively evenly distributed among the top countries.

**Discounts by Country:**
- Visualized discounts offered by country, with the United States providing the highest discounts at 2.2M.
- Discounts seem to be a significant factor in the United States' sales strategy

**Data Filtering:**
- Implemented interactive filters for selecting data by year (2013 and 2014), allowing users to dynamically adjust the displayed data.

## Recommendations:

**Optimize Sales Strategies:**

- Focus on maintaining and enhancing sales strategies in the United States, Canada, and France, which have high sales figures.
- Analyze the specific factors contributing to the high profitability in October and December to replicate these strategies in other months.
  
**Adjust Discount Policies:**

- Review the discount policies in the United States and Canada to ensure they are contributing effectively to sales without eroding profits.
- Consider targeted discounts in countries with lower profits to boost sales and market share.

**Expand Market Presence:**

- Explore opportunities to increase market presence in countries with lower profits, such as Mexico and the United States, by analyzing market demands and adjusting marketing strategies accordingly.

# Analysis on Patients Turn-up for Medical Appointment

## Project Overview:

Created an in-depth analytical dashboard using Power BI to examine factors influencing patient no-shows for medical appointments.

## Key Highlights:

**Count of Gender by No-show:**
- Designed a pie chart to analyze the distribution of no-shows by gender, revealing that 35% of no-shows were male and 65% were female.
- Provided insights into gender-related trends in appointment attendance.

**Scholarship by SMS Received and No-show:**
- Developed a bar chart to examine the correlation between receiving SMS reminders and no-show rates among scholarship recipients.
- Receiving SMS reminders significantly reduces no-show rates.

**Handicap by Neighborhood and No-show:**
- Visualized the relationship between handicaps and no-show rates across different neighborhoods.
- It was observed that neighborhoods with handicaps have a high rate of no-show.

**Count of No-show by Neighborhood and Gender:**
- Implemented a geographical map to display the count of no-shows by neighborhood and gender, offering a spatial understanding of no-show patterns.
- No-shows are concentrated in specific neighborhoods, with a noticeable pattern on the geographical map.

**Scholarship by Neighborhood:**
- Used a bar chart to represent the distribution of scholarships across various neighborhoods.
- Provided valuable data for understanding how scholarships are allocated and their impact on no-show rates.
- Scholarships are more concentrated in certain neighborhoods, potentially influencing no-show rates.

## Recommendations:

**Targeted Reminder Systems:**

- Implement more robust SMS reminder systems, especially targeting female patients and those on scholarships, to reduce no-show rates.

**Improve Accessibility:**

- Focus on improving accessibility and support for handicapped patients in neighborhoods with high no-show rates. This could include transportation services or more flexible scheduling.

**Neighborhood-Specific Strategies:**

- Develop tailored strategies for neighborhoods with high no-show rates, such as community outreach programs and localized health awareness campaigns.

**Optimize Scholarship Programs:**
- Ensure that scholarship programs are effectively communicated and that patients understand
